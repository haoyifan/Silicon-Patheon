"""Multi-thread stress tests for the server synchronisation model.

The production server runs on a single asyncio event loop — these
tests deliberately invoke tool handlers from multiple OS threads
to stress the locking regime as if we'd already moved to a
threadpool-dispatched or true-MT deployment. Passing here means
the code is ready for that transition.

Each test:
  - spawns N worker threads
  - each worker does M random state-mutating operations
  - main thread joins with a timeout — a deadlock is detected as
    "workers didn't finish in time"
  - at the end, asserts invariants (no orphan state, consistent
    reverse indices, no torn reads observed)

Wall-clock budget: every test must finish in <10s under load;
generous on a laptop, tight enough to catch deadlocks without
false positives from contended-but-progressing locks.
