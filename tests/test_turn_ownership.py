"""Regressions for the agent-turn / API ownership audit.

Bug history: an agent received a turn prompt claiming "it's your
turn", then every action it called came back `not_your_turn` from
the server. Two defects stacked:

  1. NetworkedAgent.play_turn built the prompt unconditionally. The
     decision to spawn a play_turn was made by the TUI off polled
     state that can be ~1s stale; by the time the task fetched
     fresh state, active_player could disagree with `viewer`.
  2. build_turn_prompt_from_state_dict substituted `viewer.value`
     into "It is your ({team}) turn" without verifying that
     active_player actually matched. If called with mismatched
     state it silently lied to the model.

This test pins the fixes:
  - play_turn now re-checks active_player on fresh state and
    returns early if it's not our turn (no tool calls, no prompt
    sent).
  - build_turn_prompt_from_state_dict prepends a warning block
    when the snapshot's active_player disagrees with viewer, so
    any code path that bypasses the play_turn guard still can't
    mislead the LLM.
