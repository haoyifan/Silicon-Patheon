# TODO — deferred work

Features and polish that have been explicitly **designed but not
built yet**. Entries here are more than "notes"; each should have
enough context that a future contributor (including me, next week)
can pick it up.

Grouped by area. Priority is rough — the `design decided` ones are
ready to implement in any order; `design open` ones need a round
of design review first.

## Provider adapters (beyond Anthropic + OpenAI)

Status: **design decided** in
[`docs/FLEXIBILITY_PROPOSAL.md`](docs/FLEXIBILITY_PROPOSAL.md). Each
is a drop-in `ProviderAdapter` implementation plus catalog entry.

- [ ] **Google Gemini** — use `google-generativeai` SDK. Persistent
      session via the Chat API. Function-call schema differs:
      Gemini rejects several JSON Schema keywords (`minLength`,
      `pattern`) that Anthropic / OpenAI accept; the adapter needs a
      schema-normalizer pass. Estimate: 1–2 days.
- [ ] **Ollama** (local) — no auth beyond a base URL. Use
      `ollama` Python SDK or raw `httpx`. No native persistent-
      session concept — we re-send the transcript manually each turn.
      Most local models don't support tool-use well; the adapter
      should gate on the model declaration. Estimate: 1 day for the
      adapter + 1 day fighting tool-use reliability.
- [ ] **xAI Grok** — OpenAI-compatible API; can largely reuse the
      OpenAI adapter with a different base URL once the refactor is
      clean. Estimate: 0.5 day.
- [ ] **AWS Bedrock** — different SDK (`boto3`), distinct auth chain
      (AWS SDK credentials, no single `BEDROCK_API_KEY`). Tool-use
      varies by underlying model (Claude-via-Bedrock vs.
      Titan-via-Bedrock are completely different formats). Probably
      ship only for Bedrock-Anthropic initially. Estimate: 2 days.
- [ ] **Groq / Together / Perplexity / DeepSeek** — mostly
      OpenAI-compatible endpoints; add catalog entries and let
      the OpenAI adapter drive them. Estimate: a few hours each once
      the catalog is extensible.

## Scenario engine v2 — real combat extensions

Status: **schema ready in v1**, runtime deferred. These add
behavior to fields that already exist in the schema as no-ops.

- [ ] **Damage types + tag-aware defense** — implement the
      `damage_profile` / `defense_profile` / `bonus_vs_tags` /
      `vulnerability_to_tags` matrix in `engine/combat.py`. Legacy
      stats (`atk`, `defense`, `res`) keep working for scenarios
      that don't opt in. Estimate: 2–3 days incl. tests.
- [ ] **Weapon triangle as a `tag_cycles` shortcut** — one-line
      shortcut to `bonus_vs_tags` on every weapon. Trivial once
      damage types land. Estimate: half a day.
- [ ] **MP + abilities** — add `mp` resource on Unit, new MCP
      tool `use_ability(ability_id, target)`, new action subtype
      in the engine. Default `mp_per_turn = 0` (no recharge); set
      per-scenario. Estimate: 3–4 days incl. tool, legality, combat
      resolution, TUI rendering.
- [ ] **Inventory + trade** — `trade_item(src_unit, dst_unit, item_id)`
      and `use_item(unit, item_id)` tools. Adjacency check, same-team
      constraint. Combat hooks for equipped items. Estimate: 3 days.
- [ ] **Treasure terrain** — terrain that yields an item when a unit
      ends turn on it. Depends on inventory. Estimate: 0.5 day on
      top of inventory.
- [ ] **Status effects** — buffs/debuffs with duration (e.g.
      "poisoned for 3 turns, -2 HP per end_turn"). Touches combat
      resolution + end_turn flow. Estimate: 2 days.

## TUI / client polish

- [ ] **Client-side full scenario preview** (Phase 2e in the design
      doc) — new `describe_scenario` server tool + TUI tooltips in
      the room preview showing unit stats, tags, abilities on
      hover. Estimate: 1 day server + 2 days client.
- [ ] **Post-match lesson browser** — a screen to browse the lessons
      the agent has written across runs, with search / filter by
      scenario. Estimate: 1 day.
- [ ] **In-game pause + re-sync** — some way for a spectator or the
      host to freeze a match to discuss or screenshot. Depends on
      server support. Estimate: 2 days.
- [ ] **Replay viewer inside the TUI** — we already have `clash-play`
      as a separate CLI; fold a replay-player screen into the main
      TUI so users don't context-switch. Estimate: 1 day.

## Tournament mode

Status: **out of scope for v1** per 2026-04-13 review. Design
guidance for when this gets picked up:

- [ ] **Tournament runner** as a separate CLI (`clash-tourney`) that
      orchestrates a bracket of matches with verified configs.
      Should read a bracket spec (YAML), run N matches sequentially
      or in parallel, collect results into a summary report.
- [ ] **Judge attestation** — tournament runner records
      provider + model choices per player, verifies them against an
      allow-list before each match, and stores a per-match receipt.
- [ ] **Leaderboard / Elo** — track per-agent ratings across matches
      in a persisted file.

---

## Operational / deployment

- [ ] **Public deployment hardening** — currently designed for
      private/trusted use only. For public: JWT auth, abuse
      mitigation, per-user rate limits, structured audit logs, DB
      persistence. (See `docs/PHASE_1_DESIGN.md` scaling-seams
      section for what's already prepped.)
- [ ] **Graceful server upgrade** — today restarting `clash-serve`
      drops all in-flight matches. A "drain mode" that finishes
      existing matches and refuses new ones would be useful.
- [ ] **Persistent replay archive** — server-side replays
      (`runs-server/...`) accumulate indefinitely. Rotation /
      S3 archival for long-running deployments.

## Audit residue (known-but-not-fixed)

Surfaced during the second-pass deep audit of the multi-provider /
flexible-scenarios work. Each is a real gap; left in place because
no shipping scenario hits it or because the fix is bigger than the
current symptom warrants.

- [ ] **`terrain_types` override of built-ins is partial.** A scenario
      that says `terrain_types: { plain: { passable: false } }` only
      changes tiles explicitly listed in `board.terrain`. Any tile
      not enumerated falls through to `Board.tile()`'s synthetic
      default `Tile(type="plain")`, which uses dataclass defaults
      and ignores the per-scenario table. Workaround: enumerate every
      tile. Real fix: pre-populate `Board.tiles` with the resolved
      terrain spec for every position, or have `Board.tile()` consult
      a state-level terrain-types table.

- [ ] **`describe_scenario` returns inconsistent shapes.** Built-in
      unit classes are serialized to a fixed key set; custom classes
      pass through verbatim (may have extra/missing keys). Built-in
      terrain types come back as `{}` so the UI can't display their
      default `move_cost` / `def_bonus` / `heals`. Either serialize
      both built-ins and custom uniformly, or have the client pull
      defaults from a shared constants module.

- [ ] **`PluginRule.module` field is dead.** PluginRule reads only
      `check_fn`; the `module:` key in YAML is silently ignored.
      Either drop the field (breaking change for any author who put
      it in YAML) or actually scope lookups to a named submodule
      (would matter once a scenario needs more than one plugin file).

- [ ] **Narrative `on_turn_start` event without an explicit `turn:`
      fires only on the first turn.** Consequence of the once-only
      mechanism. Authors writing `{trigger: on_turn_start, text: ...}`
      probably expected "every turn." Either document loudly or add
      an explicit `every: true` opt-in.

- [ ] **`HoldTile.consecutive_turns` counts end_turns, not full game
      turns.** `consecutive_turns: 3` means hold across three
      end_turn events ≈ 1.5 game rounds. Most authors will read
      "turns" as full rounds. Fix: compare to `state.turn` snapshots
      instead of incrementing on every end_turn.

- [ ] **`games/_test_plugin/` ships in the games directory and shows
      up in production `list_scenarios`.** UX noise; an end user
      could try to launch it and get a tiny synthetic 4×4 match.
      Either move test scenarios out of `games/` (a tests-only
      directory the engine knows about) or filter underscore-prefixed
      names from `list_scenarios`.

- [ ] **Narrative events aren't surfaced in real time to the TUI.**
      They land in `state._narrative_log`, get drained into
      `replay.jsonl` after each action, but the TUI only sees them
      via post-match replay download. F.7 in the original plan; the
      data is in hand, the rendering layer needs a small story line
      on the game screen that subscribes to the action hook and reads
      the in-flight log before drain (or the server has to include
      `narrative_events` in the action result).

- [ ] **Built-in terrain `class_overrides` not supported by override
      path either.** When a scenario declares
      `terrain_types: { forest: { ...new fields... } }`, the new
      fields take effect, but existing class_overrides on the
      built-in (none today; future-proofing) wouldn't merge — the
      override wholesale replaces. Document or implement merge.

---

## Smaller polish

- [ ] **Credentials file version field + migration** — add a
      `schema_version: 1` to `credentials.json`; silent migrate on
      read, error on newer version. Consistent with the scenario
      schema story.
- [ ] **Coach message to the opponent's agent** (ops-enabled) — let
      the operator push a message into either team's coach queue
      for testing / debugging / humor. Estimate: 1 hour.
- [ ] **Scenario validator CLI** — `clash-validate path/to/config.yaml`
      that loads a scenario through the full engine validation
      pipeline and reports errors without starting a match. Great
      for scenario authors. Estimate: 0.5 day.
- [ ] **Keyring dependency marker** — `pyproject.toml` gains
      `keyring` as an optional extra (`pip install clash-of-odin[keyring]`)
      so users who don't want it don't pay the install cost.
- [ ] **Ported `clash-server` (stdio MCP wrapper)** — the legacy
      stdio variant hasn't been touched in a while; confirm it
      still works or deprecate it. Current stance: quietly works but
      unused since clash-serve (streamable HTTP) replaced it.

## Design open — needs another review round

- [ ] **MP recharge model alternatives** — today's design defaults
      to `mp_per_turn = 0` (no recharge). Is it worth supporting
      "recharge N per end_turn" vs "recharge fully at turn start" as
      a scenario knob? Depends on whether players want FE-style
      (fully recharge) or DnD-style (slow recharge). Cheap to
      support both; decide after playtesting v2.
- [ ] **Scenario marketplace** — way for non-operator users to
      submit scenarios for review. PR workflow into the operator's
      repo is the current answer, but a dedicated submission UI + a
      review queue is eventually worth it. Requires sandboxing of
      scenario plugin code before it can be safe.
- [ ] **Reasoning budget per scenario** — scenarios could declare
      `recommended_model: claude-sonnet-4-6` or a complexity
      rating (beginner / intermediate / expert) to help players pick
      an appropriate model. Easy to add to YAML; harder to decide
      what the complexity rating actually means.
- [ ] **Per-unit sight variant: "true sight" / "terrain-modified
      sight"** — currently `sight` is pure Chebyshev distance;
      forest/mountain block. Some scenarios might want "this unit
      sees *through* forests" or "night terrain halves sight". Tag-
      aware? Plugin-based?
