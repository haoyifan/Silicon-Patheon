"""Helm's Deep plugins.

Two scheduled events:

  - Turn 4: explode_culvert. The Deeping Wall gate at (4, 5)
    becomes a passable plain tile. The wall is breached and
    uruks can pour through.

  - Turn 12: gandalf_arrives. Gandalf, Éomer, and a band of
    Rohirrim cavalry spawn at the east edge of the map (x=15)
    on the blue side, ready to charge the uruk rear.

Both events fire once and only once. Repeated calls (the engine
calls on_turn_start hooks every end_turn) are no-ops via guard
flags stored on the state.
