## Quick start

```bash
# Install dependencies.
uv sync --extra dev

# Smoke test: two random bots play the smallest scenario end-to-end.
uv run clash-match --game 01_tiny_skirmish --blue random --red random --render
```

Claude-backed providers need the `claude` CLI (Claude Code) installed and
logged in — no API key required.

---

## `clash-match` — run a match

```
clash-match [options]

Options (all optional):
  --game GAME                   scenario name (folder under games/). Default: 01_tiny_skirmish.
  --blue BLUE                   provider spec. Default: random.
  --red RED                     provider spec. Default: random.
  --blue-strategy PATH          path to a STRATEGY.md for blue (see strategies/).
  --red-strategy PATH           path to a STRATEGY.md for red.
  --max-turns N                 override the scenario's max_turns.
  --replay PATH                 explicit replay path. Default: <run-dir>/replay.jsonl.
  --render                      live TUI (board + units + agent reasoning panel).
  --seed N                      seed for random providers.
  --thoughts-height N           rows for the reasoning panel in --render mode. Default: 12.
  --coach-file-blue PATH        watch this file and send new lines to blue as coach messages.
  --coach-file-red PATH         same, for red.
  --runs-dir PATH               parent of the auto-created per-match folder. Default: ./runs.
  --no-run-dir                  don't auto-create a per-match folder.
  --lessons-dir PATH            where lessons are read from and written to. Default: ./lessons.
  --no-lessons                  skip both writing lessons AND injecting priors into prompts.
```

### Provider specs

| Spec | What it is |
|---|---|
| `random` | Picks a legal action at random. No LLM, no network, free. |
| `claude-haiku-4-5` | Cheapest Claude; fine for iteration. |
| `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Stronger; ~$X per match — see README's cost warning. |
| `claude-opus-4-6` | Strongest; slowest & priciest. |
| `gpt-*` | OpenAI stub (Phase 7; not fully wired). |

### Run directories

Every invocation creates a folder at `./runs/{timestamp}_{scenario}/` and
routes per-match artifacts into it. After a match ends you'll find:

```
runs/20260412T143022_01_tiny_skirmish/
├── replay.jsonl      every event (match_start, thoughts, actions, coach, errors)
└── thoughts.log      plain-text stream of agent reasoning, one thought per line
```

The run directory's path is printed at the start of every match. Use
`--no-run-dir` to suppress if you're iterating quickly and don't want
the clutter.

---

## Lessons

After a match ends, each Claude-backed provider writes a short
markdown lesson reflecting on one key decision or pattern that drove the
outcome. Lessons live at `./lessons/<scenario>/<slug>.md`, sharded by
scenario so the system-prompt injection in future matches only pulls
relevant priors.

### Anatomy of a lesson file

```markdown
---
title: Don't chase healers into the enemy fort
slug: dont-chase-healers-into-enemy-fort
scenario: 02_basic_mirror
team: red
model: claude-sonnet-4-6
outcome: loss
reason: seize
created_at: 2026-04-12T14:30:00+00:00
---

## Situation
Blue's mage was two tiles from our home fort with a knight escort...

## Lesson
Prioritize fort defense over kill-chasing when a healer is within
reach of the fort. A full-HP mage on a fort will outheal the damage
you can deal in two turns.
```

Filenames are slugified from the model-chosen title for searchability
(`grep -l "terrain" lessons/02_basic_mirror/`). Collisions within a
scenario disambiguate with a `-2`, `-3`, ... suffix.

### How lessons are injected

**Injection is automatic and happens in the system prompt** — no tool
call, no agent opt-in, no CLI flag needed. As long as lessons exist on
disk for the scenario you're playing, the agent sees them at the start
of every turn.

**What the agent actually sees** (appended after the rules and any
`--blue-strategy` / `--red-strategy` section):

```markdown
## Prior lessons from this scenario

These are reflections written by agents who played this scenario before you
(including past games you lost). Internalize the tactical principles — do not
just replay past moves.

### <title-of-lesson-1> [<team> <outcome>]

<body of lesson 1>

### <title-of-lesson-2> [<team> <outcome>]

<body of lesson 2>

...
```

**Selection rules:**

- **Scope**: lessons for *this scenario* only (the `scenario` field in a
  lesson's frontmatter must match `--game`). A lesson from
  `02_basic_mirror` is invisible while playing `01_tiny_skirmish`.
- **Cross-team**: both blue and red see **all** lessons for the
  scenario, regardless of which team wrote them. The `[<team> <outcome>]`
  tag tells the reader which side's perspective produced it so the agent
  can weight advice accordingly.
- **Ordering**: newest first, sorted by the `created_at` frontmatter
  field.
- **Cap**: up to **5** lessons per turn (`AnthropicProvider.max_injected_lessons`,
  defaults to 5). The cap is currently internal — edit the provider
  constructor if you need to override.
- **Cadence**: re-loaded every turn, so lessons written by one match are
  visible to the very next match on the same scenario.

**Failure modes** (all silent, by design — lessons are advisory):

- Lessons directory missing or empty → nothing injected, no warning.
- A lesson file has malformed YAML frontmatter → that one file is
  skipped via `try/except` in `LessonStore.list_for_scenario`; others
  still load.
- `--no-lessons` → disables both producer (won't write) and consumer
  (won't inject) in one switch.
- `--lessons-dir PATH` → point at a different folder; useful for
  A/B-ing a curated set.

**Want to force-inject a specific lesson?** Drop a hand-written
markdown file at `lessons/<scenario>/my-lesson.md` with correct
frontmatter. It's indistinguishable from an agent-written one once on
disk. Minimal example:

```markdown
---
title: Always check the threat map before moving cavalry
slug: threat-map-before-cavalry
scenario: 02_basic_mirror
team: coach
model: hand-written
outcome: advice
reason: ""
created_at: 2026-04-12T00:00:00+00:00
---

Cavalry dies to archers. Before moving one into the open, call
`get_threat_map` and verify no enemy archer can reach the destination tile.
```

The `team` / `outcome` / `model` fields are free-form strings; they
only feed the header tag the agent sees. `created_at` drives ordering,
so use a recent timestamp if you want your hand-written lesson to sit
above the auto-generated ones.

### Controlling lesson behavior

```bash
# Disable both writing new lessons AND injecting priors (useful while
# iterating on prompts so you don't pollute the corpus).
uv run clash-match --game 01_tiny_skirmish --no-lessons --render ...

# Point at an alternate lessons folder (e.g. to test with a curated set).
uv run clash-match --lessons-dir ./my-curated-lessons ...
```

Lessons are plain files — delete, hand-edit, or commit them to git at
will.

## Real-time reasoning

Three ways to watch the agent think:

1. **The TUI reasoning panel** (`--render`). A fixed-height panel at the
   bottom of the live view shows the last N thoughts, tagged with turn
   and team. Bump it with `--thoughts-height 30` for more context.

2. **`thoughts.log` tail** — every thought is also streamed
   line-by-line to `runs/<ts>_<scenario>/thoughts.log`. One thought per
   line, whitespace collapsed, tagged `[T{turn} {team}]`. Bidirectional
   scroll via `less`:

   ```bash
   # Find the run (printed at match start, or):
   ls -1t runs/ | head -1

   # In a second terminal, follow live:
   less +F --follow-name runs/20260412T143022_01_tiny_skirmish/thoughts.log
   #   Ctrl-C in less to pause following; / to search; q to quit.
   ```

3. **`clash-replay` pager** (post-match only). Renders the full timeline
   — thoughts + actions interleaved — through `$PAGER`. See below.

---

## Coaching during a match

A coach is a text file you append lines to while the match runs. Each
line becomes a coach message delivered to the team's agent at the start
of its next turn.

```bash
# Terminal 1 — start the match with coach file wiring:
uv run clash-match \
  --game 02_basic_mirror \
  --blue claude-sonnet-4-6 --red claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --coach-file-blue coach_blue.txt \
  --coach-file-red  coach_red.txt  \
  --render

# Terminal 2 — issue guidance at any time. One line = one message.
echo "push the cavalry on the right flank" >> coach_blue.txt
echo "fall back to the fort, they're breaking through" >> coach_blue.txt
```

The agent calls `get_coach_messages` at the start of each turn and
drains the queue. Messages logged to the replay as `coach_message`
events (visible in `clash-replay` / `clash-play`).

Tip: create the coach files before starting the match (`touch
coach_blue.txt`) so the watcher has something to follow from turn one.

---

## `clash-replay` — scrollable timeline

```
clash-replay [run_dir] [--replay PATH] [--no-pager]
```

Post-match only. Pipes the full event timeline through `$PAGER`
(usually `less`) so you get bidirectional scroll, `/` search, and `q`
quit for free. Events shown: match_start, agent thoughts, actions,
coach messages, forced end_turns, errors.

```bash
uv run clash-replay runs/20260412T143022_01_tiny_skirmish

# Grep for all seizes across a run:
uv run clash-replay --no-pager runs/... | grep seize

# Point at an arbitrary replay file:
uv run clash-replay --replay path/to/replay.jsonl
```

---

## `clash-play` — interactive step-through replayer

```
clash-play [run_dir] [--replay PATH]
```

Reconstructs the match visually, one event at a time. The board starts
at the scenario's initial state and updates as you step through actions.
Agent reasoning appears in a side panel *before* the paired action
updates the board — you see what the agent thought, then what it did.

**Commands at the prompt:**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | advance one step |
| `s` + `Enter` | skip forward past thoughts to the next action |
| `q` + `Enter` | quit |
| `Ctrl-C` | abort |

```bash
uv run clash-play runs/20260412T143022_01_tiny_skirmish
```

If the replay is older than the `match_start` metadata event
(commit `1deb07a`, 2026-04-12), the replayer will refuse with a clear
error — re-record the match to get the metadata.

---

## Complete example workflows

### 1. Run a Claude-vs-Claude match with coaching and real-time reasoning monitoring

```bash
# Pre-create the coach files so the watcher starts at turn 1.
touch coach_blue.txt coach_red.txt

# Terminal 1 — start the match.
uv run clash-match \
  --game 02_basic_mirror \
  --blue claude-haiku-4-5 --blue-strategy strategies/aggressive_rush.md \
  --red  claude-haiku-4-5 --red-strategy  strategies/defensive_chokepoint.md \
  --coach-file-blue coach_blue.txt \
  --coach-file-red  coach_red.txt  \
  --thoughts-height 20 \
  --render
# → prints: "run directory: runs/20260412T143022_02_basic_mirror"
# →         "  tail thoughts with: less +F runs/.../thoughts.log"
```

```bash
# Terminal 2 — follow the reasoning log live.
less +F --follow-name runs/20260412T143022_02_basic_mirror/thoughts.log
```

```bash
# Terminal 3 — drop coach messages into the mix as the match unfolds.
echo "focus the mage first" >> coach_blue.txt
echo "don't chase — hold the fort" >> coach_red.txt
```

When the match ends you'll see a spinner (`Blue reviewing the match…`,
`Red reviewing the match…`) while each agent writes its lesson. Lesson
files print once saved:

```
[blue] lesson saved: lessons/02_basic_mirror/commit-mage-to-the-fort.md
[red]  lesson saved: lessons/02_basic_mirror/baiting-cavalry-into-forest.md
```

### 2. Replay that match as a human

```bash
# Scrollable timeline log (fast skim, search, grep).
uv run clash-replay runs/20260412T143022_02_basic_mirror

# Interactive step-through (press Enter to advance).
uv run clash-play runs/20260412T143022_02_basic_mirror
```

### 3. Iterate on prompts without polluting the lessons corpus

```bash
uv run clash-match --game 01_tiny_skirmish \
  --blue claude-haiku-4-5 --red claude-haiku-4-5 \
  --no-lessons --render
```

`--no-lessons` disables both writing new lessons and injecting priors, so
you're evaluating the base prompt only.

### 4. Use a curated lessons set for a tournament

```bash
# Put hand-picked lessons in ./canon-lessons/<scenario>/...
uv run clash-match --game 02_basic_mirror \
  --blue claude-sonnet-4-6 --red claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --lessons-dir ./canon-lessons --render
```

### 5. Inspect the raw replay

The replay is plain JSONL — grep and jq work on it directly:

```bash
# All thoughts from the losing side of the last match.
jq -c 'select(.kind == "agent_thought")' \
  runs/20260412T143022_02_basic_mirror/replay.jsonl

# All seizes across every run.
grep -l '"reason": "seize"' runs/*/replay.jsonl
```
