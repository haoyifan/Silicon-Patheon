# Authoring Scenarios

This guide covers the scenario YAML format, plugin rules, and narrative
events. For the broader design intent, see
[FLEXIBILITY_PROPOSAL.md](FLEXIBILITY_PROPOSAL.md).

## Security & trust model

**Scenarios are operator-trusted.** A scenario's `rules.py` is imported
with full Python privileges — no sandbox. An operator who loads a
scenario from an untrusted source can have arbitrary code executed.
Only install scenarios from sources you trust.

Rationale: this is a local-play tactical game shipped by hobbyists;
sandboxing Python for a few plugin hooks is not worth the complexity
when the alternative is "don't install malware."

## Directory layout

Each scenario lives under `games/<name>/`:

```
games/my_scenario/
├── config.yaml          # required
├── rules.py             # optional — plugin callables
└── art/                 # optional — ASCII portraits per unit class
    ├── tang_monk/
    │   ├── 0.txt        # frame 0
    │   └── 1.txt        # frame 1 (animation)
    └── sun_wukong/
        └── 0.txt        # single frame, no animation
```

## ASCII portraits (optional)

Drop `<scenario>/art/<class_slug>/*.txt` files. The loader
auto-discovers them, sorts lexically, validates per-frame size, and
attaches the frames to the unit class. The TUI unit-card modal
renders the portrait above the stats; if a class has more than one
frame, the card cycles through them at **one frame every 2 seconds**.

The feature is fully optional — a scenario can ship art for some
classes, all classes, or none.

### Size limits

By default each frame is capped at **80 columns × 30 rows**. Authors
who want larger pieces can override at the scenario level:

```yaml
art_limits:
  max_cols: 120
  max_rows: 50
```

Files exceeding the cap make `load_scenario` raise — there's no
silent truncation. Pick a size your players' terminals will fit.

### Format

Plain text. Each file is one frame. Trailing newlines are stripped.
Use spaces for alignment (rows can be ragged — Rich handles uneven
widths). Color is applied team-wide (cyan for blue, red for red); art
itself is monochrome.

A two-frame "head bob" or "weapon sway" is the cheapest convincing
animation. See `games/journey_to_the_west/art/` for examples.

```

## Copyright / license tagging

Every scenario in `games/` declares its copyright status via a top-level
`license:` field. This metadata exists so the project can cleanly
separate the freely-redistributable scenarios from the fan-made ones
if we ever ship a commercial tier or need to respond to a rights
holder's request. **Please tag every scenario you contribute.**

Three values:

| `license:` | When to use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `public_domain` | Historical battles, classical literature (pre-1928 US / pre-life+70 elsewhere), mythology, folklore | Thermopylae, Cannae, Journey to the West, Arthurian legend |
| `fan_work` | Scenarios referencing characters / places / events from works still under copyright. Also set `fan_work_source:` naming the source IP and its rights holder | Helm's Deep, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Dune |
| `original` | Scenarios with characters, setting, and story fully original to you (and dedicated to the project under Apache-2.0) | `01_tiny_skirmish`, `02_basic_mirror` |

Example for a fan-work scenario:

```yaml
schema_version: 1
license: fan_work
fan_work_source: "The Lord of the Rings (J.R.R. Tolkien / Warner Bros.)"
name: Helm's Deep
description: |
  ...
```

Example for an original scenario:

```yaml
schema_version: 1
license: original
name: The Mirror Gambit
description: |
  ...
```

Fan-work scenarios are welcome here — the project exists to host them —
but keep them clearly tagged so the boundary between fan and canon
stays maintainable. If you're unsure which bucket a scenario falls into,
tag it `fan_work` and we can reclassify during PR review.

## Built-in win-condition types

| `type:`                     | Required fields                          |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `seize_enemy_fort`          | —                                        |
| `eliminate_all_enemy_units` | —                                        |
| `max_turns_draw`            | `turns?` (override scenario cap)         |
| `protect_unit`              | `unit_id`, `owning_team`                 |
| `reach_tile`                | `team`, `pos`, `unit_id?`                |
| `hold_tile`                 | `team`, `pos`, `consecutive_turns?`      |
| `reach_goal_line`           | `team`, `axis: x\|y`, `value`            |
| `plugin`                    | `module`, `check_fn`, `kwargs?`          |

## Writing a plugin (`rules.py`)

```python
"""games/my_scenario/rules.py — scenario-local callables."""

from silicon_pantheon.server.engine.state import Pos, Team, Unit, UnitStatus
from silicon_pantheon.server.engine.units import make_stats
from silicon_pantheon.server.engine.state import UnitClass


def poison_damage(state, unit, tile, hook):
    """Terrain effects_plugin. Returns {'hp_delta': -N}."""
    return {"hp_delta": -3}


def spawn_wave(state, turn: int, team: str, **_):
    """on_turn_start plugin_hook. Spawn reinforcements on turn 5."""
    if turn != 5 or team != "red":
        return
    stats = make_stats(UnitClass.KNIGHT)
    state.units["u_r_wave_1"] = Unit(
        id="u_r_wave_1",
        owner=Team.RED,
        class_="knight",
        pos=Pos(3, 0),
        hp=stats.hp_max,
        status=UnitStatus.READY,
        stats=stats,
    )


def custom_win_check(state, hook, **kwargs):
    """Called via win_conditions: [{type: plugin, check_fn: custom_win_check}]."""
    if hook != "end_turn":
        return None
    if some_condition(state):
        return {"winner": "blue", "reason": "custom_victory"}
    return None
```

Name visibility: only module-level names **not** starting with `_`
appear in the plugin namespace.

## Narrative triggers

| `trigger`           | Fires when                           | Matches on              |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `on_turn_start`     | start of each team's turn            | `turn` (optional)       |
| `on_unit_killed`    | a unit's HP hits 0 in combat         | `unit_id` (optional)    |
| `on_plugin`         | a plugin explicitly fires this hook  | `tag`                   |

Each event fires **at most once per match**. Events render in the TUI
game panel and land in `replay.jsonl` as `kind: narrative_event`.
