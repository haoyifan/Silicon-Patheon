"""MCP-facing wrappers around the 13 in-process game tools.

Each MCP tool derives the player's viewer (Team.BLUE/RED) from the
connection's slot in its room, looks up the room's authoritative
Session, dispatches to the existing in-process tool layer, and
returns a structured result.

Phase 1a: only one hardcoded "dev room" exists, created by the
`create_dev_game` tool. Phase 1b replaces that with proper lobby /
create_room / join_room flow.

The heavy lifting stays in `server/tools/__init__.py` — these are
thin dispatch wrappers so fog-of-war filtering (1c) can slot into a
single transform that every game tool output passes through.
