"""MCP streamable-HTTP client wrapper.

Wraps the raw mcp SDK client bits into a small async-only API that
matches how our tools look from the caller's perspective: pass a
tool name + kwargs, get back the structured dict the server returned.

All transport errors bubble up as-is so the caller can distinguish
"network said no" from "tool returned {ok: false, error: ...}".
