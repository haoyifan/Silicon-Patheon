"""Viewer filter: central info-redaction for fog of war.

Every tool response that would reveal state passes through this module.
It is the one audit surface for "does this tool leak information" —
if you see a fog bug, it's a bug in this file and a few callers.

Design invariants (enforced by tests in tests/test_fog.py):

  - An enemy unit never appears in a view when its position isn't in
    `visible_tiles(state, ctx.team)` under modes `classic` /
    `line_of_sight`.
  - Own-team units always appear.
  - `none` mode returns state unchanged (filter is identity).
  - For `classic`, terrain reveal is a superset of `line_of_sight`
    given the same `ever_seen`.
