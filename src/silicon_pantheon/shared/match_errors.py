"""Detect tool-response shapes that mean "stop acting this turn."

When the server rejects a tool call with an error that indicates
"the situation has changed out from under you and no further action
makes sense right now", a weak LLM will often apologise and retry
the same tool repeatedly, burning provider tokens and holding the
worker hung until the 45-min turn deadline. grok-3-mini has been
observed in production doing this for both:

  - ``game is already over`` (match finished between the adapter's
    get_state and its next end_turn)
  - ``not your turn`` (turn was force-ended server-side while the
    adapter was still iterating)

Plus state-loss error codes that indicate the session itself is gone
(GAME_NOT_STARTED / TOOL_NOT_AVAILABLE_IN_STATE / NOT_REGISTERED /
NOT_IN_ROOM) — nothing the agent does this turn will do anything
useful, so we should exit the loop.

This module is the single source of truth for that detection so every
adapter and the bridge's dispatcher apply the same rule. If the server
grows a new signal that means "stop for this turn", add it here and
every adapter picks it up for free.
