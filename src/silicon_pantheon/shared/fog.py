"""Pure visibility computation for fog of war.

Given a GameState and a team, returns the set of tiles that team can
currently see. Uses Chebyshev-bounded sight cones plus a Bresenham
line-of-sight check in which forest and mountain tiles are opaque
(they are themselves visible, but they block sight of tiles beyond
them unless the viewer is directly adjacent).

Intended to be imported by both the server (for tool-response filtering)
and clients (for rendering their view). Must not touch server or client
state.
