"""NetworkedAgent — provider-agnostic orchestrator for one player.

Composition: one `ProviderAdapter` (picked from the user's
credentials, defaulting to Anthropic) + the remote `ServerClient` +
the local scenario + strategy + lesson context. Every
per-turn interaction — building the turn prompt, dispatching tool
calls back through the server, surfacing reasoning — routes through
this class; the concrete LLM never leaks into the TUI.

Persistent-session default: the adapter opens its session on the
first `play_turn` and reuses it until `close()`, so the agent keeps
its chain-of-thought across turns within a single match.

    The TUI's own `get_state` call path doesn't go through this — it
    uses `ServerClient.call` directly for rendering, so art_frames,
    display_name, etc. stay available. Agent-bound responses get the
    same turn-dynamic unit shape the per-turn prompt uses.

    Slimming targets:
      - get_state.units → strip per-unit static stats (handled
        by _slim_unit) — keeps id/owner/class/pos/hp/status/alive.
      - get_state.board.tiles → DROPPED entirely. The terrain map
        is invariant during a match (plugin mutations are rare and
        scenario-announced) and is already shipped in the system
        prompt's map_grid section. Re-shipping all 180+ tiles on
        every get_state call was the dominant within-turn token
        sink — the agent would call get_state 10+ times mid-turn
        and each call cost ~5KB of redundant terrain. Removing it
        cuts a typical 18×10 board's per-call payload by ~70%.
      - _visible_tiles annotation → DROPPED. Same reason — agent
        already knows the board shape from the system prompt and
        can reason about visibility from unit positions.
      - get_unit / get_legal_actions / simulate_attack /
        get_threat_map — already lean.
      - get_history — entries are small action dicts.
