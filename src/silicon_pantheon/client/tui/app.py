"""TUIApp: screen-routing frame + main event loop.

Architecture
------------
- `TUIApp` owns shared state: the ServerClient (once connected), a
  ScreenStack of one Screen at a time, a rich.Console, and a
  rich.Live.
- Each concrete Screen subclass implements `render()` and
  `handle_key()`, optionally `tick()` for periodic refresh.
- The main loop runs three concurrent asyncio tasks:
    (1) key_reader: blocks on stdin in cbreak mode via to_thread,
        pushes keys into an asyncio.Queue.
    (2) ticker: wakes every `tick_interval_s`, calls screen.tick()
        + refreshes the Live.
    (3) dispatcher: pops keys off the queue, calls
        screen.handle_key(); swaps the screen if a new one is returned.
- Screens can schedule MCP tool calls directly via `app.client.call()`
  since we're on the same asyncio loop.

Typing the key literals
-----------------------
Key returns from the reader mirror `silicon-play`'s:
  - "enter"   for newline
  - single lowercase characters for printable keys
  - "up" / "down" / "left" / "right" for arrow escape sequences
