"""Panel framework: a screen is a focused list of panels.

Each panel renders into one slot of a Rich Layout and decides what to
do with the keys that arrive while it's focused. The screen owns the
focus state and routes keys: Tab / Shift-Tab cycle focus across
focusable panels; everything else goes to the focused panel.

A focused panel paints its border in `FOCUSED_BORDER_STYLE`; other
panels use `IDLE_BORDER_STYLE`. Panels that can't take focus
(static-info ones) say so by overriding `can_focus()`.

Why a base class instead of duck typing: the screen uses .title and
.can_focus() at every render and key dispatch, and the explicit base
catches typos at import time instead of at first keystroke.

    Returns the new offset when the key was a scroll key (caller
    should assign it back), or None when the key wasn't recognized
    — caller should fall through to its own handling.

    Scroll offset semantics are panel-dependent: most panels treat
    0 as "top of content" and grow forward as you read further
    down. ReasoningPanel inverts (0 = tail / newest, growing means
    "back in time"), so it should pass step_backward+step_forward
    swapped — or just reinterpret up/down to suit its semantics.

    Shortcuts covered (only relevant when the panel has focus and
    the panel takes no text input):
      - j / ↓ / down         → step_forward
      - k / ↑ / up           → step_backward

      - home                 → top
      - g (when `gg_state` is a primed [True]) → top
        `gg_state` is a single-element list used as a one-shot
        latch: on first 'g' the caller should set it to [True] and
        call us again; on the second 'g' we jump to top and reset
        it. Pass None to disable gg; in that case single 'g' is
        ignored.

    `bottom` caps the maximum offset — readers don't need to pass
    the real max if they'd prefer to clamp themselves.

    Panels with per-line scroll offsets were buggy because a row like

    block at once.

    Pass the rendered `rows` list through this helper before applying
    the scroll offset. Text rows are split on explicit '\\n' and
    textwrap-wrapped to `inner_width`; non-Text renderables pass
    through as-is (scrolling one Table or Group is still atomic —
    convert those to Text rows in the panel if you need finer
    control).

    `inner_width` should approximate the panel's inner content width
