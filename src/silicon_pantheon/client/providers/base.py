"""Common interface every provider adapter implements.

The rest of the client talks to `ProviderAdapter` only — the code
that drives matches, handles reasoning callbacks, runs the post-
match summary, and manages session lifecycle doesn't know or care
which SDK lives behind the interface.

Lifecycle
---------
  provider = build_provider(...)           # factory chooses concrete class
  provider.system_prompt = "..."           # set once
  for turn in range(max_turns):
      await provider.play_turn(
          user_prompt="...",
          tools=[...],
          tool_dispatcher=dispatch_fn,
          on_thought=on_thought,
      )
  lesson = await provider.summarize_match(...)
  await provider.close()

All methods are async. Persistent-session providers (Anthropic,
OpenAI) open their SDK client lazily on first `play_turn` and
reuse it across turns. `close()` tears everything down.

Tool passing
------------
Tools are described in a provider-agnostic `ToolSpec` (name,
description, JSON-schema input). Each adapter converts these to
its provider's native tool/function format. Tool calls are
executed by the host-provided `tool_dispatcher`, which is a thin
wrapper around the remote MCP game tools.
