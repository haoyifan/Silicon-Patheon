"""OpenAI adapter — Chat Completions API + function calling.

Persistent session model: we keep a single `messages: list[dict]`
transcript per match. `play_turn` appends the system (on turn 1)
+ user prompt, then loops: send → receive → dispatch any tool
calls → append results → send again, until the model stops
emitting tool calls or we hit the time budget. The transcript
continues across turns so chain-of-thought persists.

Manual transcript maintenance (rather than the Responses API's
server-side conversation storage) keeps the adapter simple and
portable to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (xAI, Together, Groq,
etc. — see TODO.md for those).

        Called at the START of each new turn's play_turn — every
        message already in self._messages is from a completed turn
        and safe to rewrite. Earlier strategy was "drop tool_calls
        and tool messages, keep prose only" but that broke xAI /
        Grok: with no `tool_calls` examples in their own conversation
        history, those models fell back to emitting
        `<function_call>...</function_call>` in plain text.

        Current strategy preserves the SHAPE of the conversation:

          - system / user — kept verbatim.
          - assistant — keep content (capped to _ASST_CONTENT_CAP)
            AND keep tool_calls field as-is. The model needs to
            see "I called these tools last turn" so it knows the
            native tool_calls protocol is the right way.
          - tool — keep the message structure (role + tool_call_id)
            but replace .content with a small stub. This keeps the
            transcript valid (every assistant.tool_calls has its
            matching tool result) AND drops the heavy payload that
            was the actual problem (get_state dumps were the main
            offender).

        The token cost per "stubbed" tool round-trip drops from
        ~5KB to ~80 bytes while the model still sees both halves
        of the conversation, including the proper tool-call shape.
