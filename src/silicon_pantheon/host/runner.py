"""Auto-host runner — spawns N workers and maintains them.

Usage::

    silicon-host config.toml
    silicon-host config.toml --log auto_host.log

The runner:
  1. Parses the TOML config.
  2. Sets up file logging.
  3. Spawns one async task per [[worker]].
  4. Prints a live status line to stdout (refreshed every second).
  5. On Ctrl-C, cancels all workers and exits cleanly.

    """Trap anyio cancel-scope mismatches that fire on loop shutdown.

    Background: BotWorker._disconnect uses ``asyncio.wait_for(
    transport_ctx.__aexit__(...), timeout=5.0)`` to bound how long a
    dead transport can hold up reconnect (the underlying SSE stream
    may already be wedged when teardown starts; without the bound we
    hang forever in __aexit__). When the timeout fires the
    streamablehttp_client async generator is left half-closed.
    Asyncio's loop shutdown then runs ``athrow`` on it from its own
    cleanup task, but the generator's anyio cancel scope was entered
    in our worker task, so anyio raises:

        RuntimeError: Attempted to exit cancel scope in a different
        task than it was entered in

    The damage at that point is cosmetic — the leave_room / DELETE
    /mcp calls already succeeded server-side before teardown began.
    But asyncio's default handler logs a multi-frame ERROR traceback
    that looks like a real bug, AND Python still exits 0 because the
    main coroutine returned normally. Combined those mislead
    operators (and the systemtest orchestrator) into reporting
    "clean exit" when the bot's shutdown actually went sideways.

    We can't fix the root anyio/MCP cross-task teardown without
    forking either lib, but we CAN:

      1. Demote the cancel-scope traceback to a single WARNING line.
      2. Flip a module-global so main() can promote the exit code.

    Anything else (real bugs unrelated to MCP teardown) flows through
    asyncio's default handler unchanged.
