"""Single bot worker — the room lifecycle loop.

Each worker is an independent async task that:
  1. Connects to the server and declares metadata.
  2. Creates a room with the configured scenario + settings.
  3. Readies up and waits for a visitor to join + ready.
  4. Plays the game via NetworkedAgent.
  5. Summarizes the match (lesson).
  6. Leaves the room and loops back to step 2.

On provider errors (rate limit, auth), the worker waits and retries.
On transport errors, it reconnects.
