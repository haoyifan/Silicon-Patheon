"""Temporary diagnostic harness for the "SSE response drops mid-write"
bug tracked from 2026-04-20 onward.

Observed symptom: silicon-serve closes its loopback TCP to Caddy after
3-25 ms into an SSE response. Caddy aborts forwarding with
``use of closed network connection``. Client sees
``incomplete chunked read``. Tool handler then finds the per-request
SSE stream already cleaned up → ``Request stream <N> not found`` in
the MCP SDK, response dropped, client hangs until its 90s watchdog.

This module bundles three diagnostics behind a single ``--diagnose-sse``
flag so we can rip it all out once the root cause is understood:

    1. Monkey-patch ``sse_starlette.EventSourceResponse.__call__`` to
       log entry / exit / exception with the MCP session id from headers
       so we know WHEN each SSE response started and HOW it ended.
    2. Monkey-patch
       ``StreamableHTTPServerTransport._clean_up_memory_streams`` to
       log each cleanup with a short call-stack, so we see WHO popped
       the request stream before the tool response arrived.
    3. Spawn tcpdump on the loopback interface with a rolling pcap
       buffer so we can diff the SSE close (FIN vs RST) against the
       Python-level events.

EVERYTHING here is tagged ``# DIAG(sse)`` so it's greppable for
removal. None of it runs unless ``--diagnose-sse`` is passed.
