"""MCP server application.

Holds the authoritative in-memory state (connections, rooms, tokens)
and exposes the game + lobby tool surface over MCP streamable HTTP.

Connection identity model
-------------------------

Clients pass a `connection_id` argument on every tool call. The
server treats that argument as the primary key for its per-connection
state table.

Registration gate: only `set_player_metadata` may create a new
Connection for an unknown connection_id. All other tools look up the
connection via `get_connection()` and reject unknown IDs with a
NOT_REGISTERED error. `heartbeat` tolerates unknown IDs (returns
server_time without creating state) so it cannot be used as a
registration backdoor.

Threading / synchronisation model
---------------------------------

See docs/THREADING.md for the full policy. Short version:

* `App._state_lock` is a `threading.RLock` that guards every mutable
  field on App, every Room field (via `app.rooms._rooms`), and every
  field on a Connection EXCEPT `last_heartbeat_at` (a single float
  store, GIL-atomic, deliberately lock-free so the heartbeat tool is
  ~free).
* `Session.lock` is a `threading.Lock` that guards all per-match game
  state and telemetry.
* `ReplayWriter._lock` and `ThoughtsLogWriter._lock` are leaves.
* Acquisition order (strict): `_state_lock` → `session.lock` →
  writer locks. Never reverse. Never hold a lower lock while
  acquiring a higher one.
* Never `await` anything while holding a lock — the lock is a
  `threading.Lock`/`RLock`, which would block the asyncio event loop.
* Never call user-registered hooks with `_state_lock` held. Hooks
  fire under `session.lock` (documented) and MUST NOT acquire any
  other server lock.
