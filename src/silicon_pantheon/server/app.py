"""MCP server application.

Holds the authoritative in-memory state (connections, rooms, tokens)
and exposes the game + lobby tool surface over MCP streamable HTTP.

Connection identity model
-------------------------

Clients pass a `connection_id` argument on every tool call. The
server treats that argument as the primary key for its per-connection
state table.

Registration gate: only `set_player_metadata` may create a new
Connection for an unknown connection_id. All other tools look up the
connection via `get_connection()` and reject unknown IDs with a
NOT_REGISTERED error. `heartbeat` tolerates unknown IDs (returns
server_time without creating state) so it cannot be used as a
registration backdoor.
