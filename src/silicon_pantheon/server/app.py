"""MCP server application.

Holds the authoritative in-memory state (connections, rooms, tokens)
and exposes the game + lobby tool surface over MCP streamable HTTP.

Connection identity model for Phase 1a
---------------------------------------

Proper MCP auth via HTTP headers will land in Phase 1b alongside the
join-room / per-match token flow. For Phase 1a we keep the
state-shape clean by having the client pass a `connection_id`
argument on every tool call. The server treats that argument as the
primary key for its per-connection state table.

This is functionally equivalent to carrying a header token and lets
us validate the tool contract end-to-end; switching to headers in 1b
is a middleware-only change that does not touch tool handlers.
