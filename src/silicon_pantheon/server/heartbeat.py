"""Server-side heartbeat sweeper.

Simple liveness model:

  1. **Heartbeat = alive.** As long as the client sends heartbeats
     (every ~10s), the server treats it as alive regardless of state.
     A human on PostMatchScreen for an hour? Fine. AFK during their
     turn? The turn timer handles that separately; the connection
     stays.

  2. **No heartbeat = dead.** If heartbeats stop for HEARTBEAT_DEAD_S
     (45s = ~4 missed beats), the client is presumed crashed / network
     down. The server evicts: vacates room seat, concedes game.

  3. **Unready timeout.** If a player sits in a room without readying
     for UNREADY_TIMEOUT_S (600s = 10 min), they're evicted back to
     the lobby. Prevents a stale joiner from blocking the host.

  4. **Per-turn time limit.** If the active player hasn't called
     end_turn within `room.config.turn_time_limit_s` of their turn
     start, the server force-ends their turn. The turn passes to
     the opponent; any partial moves already made stick; pending
     units are marked DONE and skipped. Game does NOT concede —
     just the turn forfeits. Handles: hung models, upstream API
     stalls, infinite reasoning loops, disconnected-but-still-
     heartbeating clients. See `_force_end_turn` for the
     bypass-pending-actions path.

No soft-disconnect tiers, no game-activity tracking, no multi-stage
state machine. Three timers, four rules.

    "Snapshot then process": grab lightweight snapshots of

    Why: holding state_lock for the full sweep body would block
    every tool handler for the duration. The sweep iterates O(N
    connections + M rooms) and does I/O (logging, possibly
    leaderboard writes via _auto_concede). Instead we do the

    Used by the per-turn-limit sweep rule. The engine's normal

    active player's units are in status MOVED (moved but hasn't
    finalized the turn's attack/heal/wait). That's the right guard
    for a cooperating client, but the point of this path is the
    client HAS stopped cooperating — we need to finalize the turn
    regardless. Pending MOVED units are force-marked DONE so the
    engine's end-of-turn hooks can run cleanly.

    Partial progress sticks — any moves/attacks already recorded
    stay. Only the PENDING-but-not-yet-resolved actions are dropped.

    Game-over semantics: this does NOT concede the game. It only
    ends the turn. If the turn-end itself triggers a win condition
    (e.g. max_turns_draw, reach_tile from the other side on their
    previous turn), that's picked up by the engine's normal check
    in apply(EndTurnAction) and _note_game_over_if_needed fires.

    ── Concurrency ──
    Acquires ``session.lock`` to serialise with cooperative tool
    handlers in ``game_tools._dispatch``. Concurrent client
    ``end_turn`` + force-end would otherwise both call
    ``apply(EndTurnAction)``, double-flipping ``active_player`` and
    corrupting the turn counter.

    We use **non-blocking acquire** so the sweep can't freeze if a
    tool handler is holding the session lock (in the current single-
    threaded asyncio model that can't happen anyway; in a future
    threadpool / true-MT world it would be worth avoiding anyway).
    If the lock is busy, we skip and retry on the next sweep tick
    (~1s later). The default turn limit is 1800s — missing 1800
    sweep ticks would require a session lock held solid for 30
    minutes, which is a bug in its own right.

    ``_note_game_over_if_needed`` is called AFTER ``session.lock``
    is released — it has its own 3-phase locking protocol and
    would violate our order if invoked inside session.lock
    (state_lock > session.lock, never reversed).
