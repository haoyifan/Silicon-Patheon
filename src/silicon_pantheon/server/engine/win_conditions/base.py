"""Framework for declarative win conditions.

The engine exposes two hook points that condition types consult:

  - `end_turn` — fires inside `_apply_end_turn` after handover, before
    the fall-through "no winner" return.
  - `on_unit_killed` — fires inside attack resolution when HP hits 0.

`check(state, hook, **event_kwargs)` returns a `WinResult` to declare
a winner / draw / loss, or None to pass.

Scenarios list conditions in YAML; `build_conditions(cfg_list)`
instantiates the right classes with their kwargs. `default_conditions()`
returns the equivalent of today's hardcoded checks for scenarios that
don't define their own list.
