    ``viewer`` is reserved for future fog-of-war support at this
    layer; today the raw dict returned here is the FULL state and
    fog filtering is applied separately by ``filter_state`` in the
    dispatch layer (see ``server/game_tools.py::_apply_filter``).

    ``fog_of_war`` is passed through to the response so agents can
    read the effective fog mode from any ``get_state`` call and
    reason correctly about what ``units`` does or doesn't contain.
    Previously agents had no way to tell whether the unit list was
    fog-filtered — they'd look at their scenario config (which no
    longer records fog mode), guess wrong, and file state-
    inconsistency bug reports when ``get_state``'s filtered unit
    count disagreed with ``win_progress``'s unfiltered one. Room is
    the single source of truth.
