"""Server-side heartbeat sweeper + disconnect state machine.

Clients are expected to call the `heartbeat` tool every ~10s. This
module runs a single asyncio task per App that checks every
connection's last_heartbeat_at once a second and applies the
disconnect rules from the Phase 1 design doc:

  - 30s silent: connection → soft_disconnect
  - in_room 30s soft: seat vacated; room reverts to waiting
  - in_game 60s soft: opponent notified (log entry; no tool event yet)
  - in_game 120s soft: disconnected player auto-concedes

Design priorities:

  - The sweeper is the *only* place these timers fire, so the logic
    is auditable in one spot.
  - State transitions are idempotent; running the sweeper twice in a
    row on the same connection is a no-op.
  - Cancelling the sweeper cleanly stops the task.
