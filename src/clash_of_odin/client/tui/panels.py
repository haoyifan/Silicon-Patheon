"""Panel framework: a screen is a focused list of panels.

Each panel renders into one slot of a Rich Layout and decides what to
do with the keys that arrive while it's focused. The screen owns the
focus state and routes keys: Tab / Shift-Tab cycle focus across
focusable panels; everything else goes to the focused panel.

A focused panel paints its border in `FOCUSED_BORDER_STYLE`; other
panels use `IDLE_BORDER_STYLE`. Panels that can't take focus
(static-info ones) say so by overriding `can_focus()`.

Why a base class instead of duck typing: the screen uses .title and
.can_focus() at every render and key dispatch, and the explicit base
catches typos at import time instead of at first keystroke.
